Capstone-1 Nail's Beauty
It's a e-commerce website build with HTML, css, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript. It contains the home, products, product details, checkout, login, and registration page. The home page shows the feature and upcoming product, and you are able to get into the product page through the carousel.

The product page uses a card component to display the image, name, and price of the product. The customer can add products directly to the cart without going to the product details page.

The product details page have a carousel to show more image of the product and also have customer review and recommended product. Customers can quickly go to the login page and edit the cart by clicking the button on the right corner of the navigation bar.

There’s an order form for customized service. Also, the contact information form for check out is required one to fill in certain information in order to process the action.

It’s a sidebar that can hide on the left/right/bottom of the page. And activate by setting the button:

Also, you can set the width of the sidebar when it shows up in CSS
